# queenbee2 
Queenbee was the first project I created for my graded unit while studying the first year in Web Development at Edinburgh College
The premise was to create a website for a company based in the Scottish Borders, Queen Bee who pride themselves in selling 
only quality product and everything for sale is handmade by Queen Bee using locally sourced ingredients, 
and are very passionate about producing the finest pure Scottish honey but in a sustainable way. 
The project involved:
Coding using HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript
Creating a Design Brief
Wireframes, Moodboard and Prototype
Detailed Planning Specifications: Analysis of the Brief, Definition of project requirements, Project Management
Development Stage: Design documentation, web-based product that meets the brief
Testing Strategy and Professional standards
Evaluation Stage
